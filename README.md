# Equivalib

This is a Python library that provides testers and developers with a
systematic approach to generate problem instances. The library
facilitates the creation of test inputs based on defined equivalence
classes, which is an essential technique in equivalence partitioning
within software testing. This tool is designed to support the complex
task of identifying and delineating equivalence classes and their
corresponding test cases in a rigorous yet intuitive manner.
